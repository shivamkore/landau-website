            <h1 class="title">Our History</h1>
			<div class="header_text">In 1938, Rudolph Landau began selling workman's uniforms to service station and garage employees by driving from garage to garage calling on customers. As sales grew, Rudolph was able to move the business out of his Model A Ford and into a retail store
				located in the heart of Memphis' medical center.</div>
			<div class="body_container">
				<div class="left">
					<div class="text">Shifting the retail store's focus from work clothing to healthcare clothing, Rudolph built alliances with Memphis hospitals to ensure the Landau store serviced all the hospital employees' uniform needs. While his wife Bessie took care of the books,
						Rudolph was responsible for sales until his death in 1957. Later that year, after Rudolph's son Nat graduated college and returned to Memphis to help his mother run the business. Nat's vision was to take the business to another level by becoming
						a manufacturer. Originally the manufacturing 'division' consisted of five seamstresses sewing just a couple of basic lab coats in the basement of the retail store.</div>
					<div class="text">As the business slowly grew, Nat was able to take greater risks by developing unique products. Over time, many of these were successful, and the company was able to expand into our own manufacturing plant.</div>
				</div>
				<div class="right">
					<div class="text">On account of Nat's values, the continual reinvestment in employees’ development and state-of-the-art technology resulted in a thriving business. In the early 1980s, Landau was the first manufacturer to introduce scrubs in fashion-focused colors,
						creating a new market for the healthcare industry. In the late 1980s, Landau created another new market for the healthcare industry by introducing print designs. Thanks to these key innovations, the business continued to grow further expanding our
						manufacturing facilities.</div>
					<div class="text">In 1992, a third generation of Landaus entered the family business: Bruce and Gregg. Nat, Bruce and Gregg—along with more than 1,600 associates—base our relationships with employees, customers and vendors on a commitment to personal and professional
						integrity and to excellent service. Remaining true to these core values, we have enjoyed partnerships lasting 25 years and more. At Landau, we believe that our joint future is brighter than ever.</div>
