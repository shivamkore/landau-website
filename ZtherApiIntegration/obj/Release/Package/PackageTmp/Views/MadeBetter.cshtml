                    Nearly 50 years ago, five seamstresses began sewing uniforms in the basement of the Landau retail store. Today, Landau is more than 1,000 associates dedicated to making the highest quality scrubs available — scrubs that make you look and feel your
                    very best.

                <div class="body">We're a third-generation family business making scrubs ourselves, from fabric to finish. We take pride in the products we produce standing behind every stitch of every garment we make. That’s why our name is on the label.</div>

                        Landau's most popular scrubs begin with an exclusive fabric construction that sets the standard in the industry. Before we sew a single stitch, we test each roll of fabric for durability, shade consistency and color-fastness. Our demands are high.
                        When fabric falls short of our standards, we discard it, passing it off for use by other scrubs manufacturers.

                        draw inspiration from trendsetters in the fashion world and customers like you in the working world to create stylish designs that fit comfortably and flatter.

                        are always true to size.

                        To us, the details are everything. You might even say we're obsessed. That's why we meticulously inspect every single roll of fabric we make, every single style we design and every single garment we sew. And when our scrubs are finished, we go back
                        and inspect them again.
