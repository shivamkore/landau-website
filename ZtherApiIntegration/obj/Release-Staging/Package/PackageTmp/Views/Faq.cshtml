                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Nearly 50 years ago, five seamstresses began sewing uniforms in the basement of the Landau retail store. Today, Landau is more than 1,000 associates dedicated to making the highest quality scrubs available—scrubs that make you look and feel you’re very best.
                        <br><br>We're a third-generation family business making scrubs ourselves, from fabric to finish. We take pride in the products we produce standing behind every stitch of every garment we make. That’s why our name is on the label.

                        I just bought a new pair of Landau scrubs, should I wear them before washing?
                    </div>
                    <p>For maximum product life and to protect and set the fabric dye as firmly as possible, we recommend washing garments before wearing them the first time. To wash them simply add one cup (8 oz.) of white vinegar to your wash. Adding the vinegar will prevent colors from fading, and give you a natural fabric softener. Don't worry, the vinegar smell goes away in the wash.</p>

                        What can I do to minimize the chance of my scrubs' color fading over multiple washes?

                    <p>
                        Follow these 5 steps to keep your scrubs looking their best.
                        <br><br><span>Check the Label for Care Instructions</span>: Check the Label for Care Instructions: It only takes a few seconds, but reading the care labels may save a lot of heartache when your scrubs come out of the wash. Care instructions will provide you pertinent information on how to wash your garments. Don't forget to check for drying instructions as well. The label may indicate that the clothing needs to be dried on low heat, or drip dried.
                        <br><br><span>Turn Garments Inside Out</span>: Much of the wear and tear that happens to your scrubs can be prevented by turning your garments inside out before washing and drying. Washing and drying clothing is rough on the outside of your clothing. Turning garments inside out will reduce pilling which dulls the look of the fabric. Don't forget to turn clothing inside out when you hang clothes outside to dry, as well. While the sun is an excellent drying source, it will zap the color right out of your uniforms.
                        <br><br><span>Use Gentle Cycle Wash and a Gentle Non-Chlorine Bleach Detergent</span>: Never wash your scrubs in chlorine bleach as it will fade the color of your scrubs. Hydrogen Peroxide, like bleach can damage the color integrity of your garments. Instead, use detergents such as Tide® to protect the color integrity. Always wash your scrubs in cold water. Detergents have come a long way in the last several years, and most do as well in cold water as they do in hot or warm.
                        <br><br><span>Rinse Your Washer</span>: Although all scrubs may look alike, being contentious of how many scrubs you wash each load is important. Loads with bleach or bleach alternative may leave a residue in your wash basin. As a result, it is important to rinse out your washer between cycles. This will prevent fading or unnecessary discoloring of garments in loads to follow.
                        <br><br><span>Don't Over Dry</span>: It's easy to let our scrubs over dry. While this is bad for all of our laundry, it is particularly bad for our bright and dark colored uniforms. Over drying will cause your colors to fade.
