            <h1>LOYALTY RULES REMINDER:</h1>
            <p>You must sign-up for the loyalty program to accumulate points. Points are earned from the time you sign-up and only on future activity.</p>
            <p>In addition to receiving exclusive insider information, Loyalty Members may also be eligible to participate in our “points based” rewards program. Depending upon the number of points earned, users can redeem them towards exclusive swag and gear.</p>
            <p>Points are earned with social engagements, inviting a friend, reviewing a product, product purchases, and more from the time you become a member of the Rewards Program. Additional points can be awarded based off special promotions, events, contests or sweepstakes. Points can be redeemed in increments equal to the value of the swag and gear offered in our loyalty gifts section of our loyalty site. Points may not be shared on different Landau Family of Brands sites. Meaning, loyalty points are separate for each loyalty account including: Landau, Urbane, and Smitten. All unused points will expire within a year of issue date.</p>
